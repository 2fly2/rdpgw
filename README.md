GO Remote Desktop Gateway
=========================

:star: Star us on GitHub â€” it helps!

RDPGW is an implementation of the [Remote Desktop Gateway protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-tsgu/0007d661-a86d-4e8f-89f7-7f77f8824188).
This allows you connect with the official Microsoft clients to remote desktops that are made available over HTTPS. 
These desktops could be, for example, [XRDP](http://www.xrdp.org) desktops running in containers
on Kubernetes.

## AIM
RDPGW aims to provide a full open source replacement for MS Remote Desktop Gateway, 
including access policies.
