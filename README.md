GO Remote Desktop Gateway
=========================

![Go](https://github.com/bolkedebruin/rdpgw/workflows/Go/badge.svg)

:star: Star us on GitHub â€” it helps!

RDPGW is an implementation of the [Remote Desktop Gateway protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-tsgu/0007d661-a86d-4e8f-89f7-7f77f8824188).
This allows you to connect with the official Microsoft clients to remote desktops over HTTPS. 
These desktops could be, for example, [XRDP](http://www.xrdp.org) desktops running in containers
on Kubernetes.

## AIM
RDPGW aims to provide a full open source replacement for MS Remote Desktop Gateway, 
including access policies.

## How to build
```bash
cd rdpgw
go build -o rdpgw .
```

## Configuration
By default the configuration is read from `rdpgw.yaml`. Below is a 
template.

```yaml
# web server configuration. 
server:
 # TLS certificate files (required)
 certFile: server.pem
 keyFile: key.pem
 # gateway address advertised in the rdp files
 gatewayAddress: localhost
 # port to listen on
 port: 443
 # list of acceptable desktop hosts to connect to
 hosts:
  - localhost:3389
  - my-{{ preferred_username }}-host:3389
  # Allow the user to connect to any host (insecure)
  - any 
 # if true the server randomly selects a host to connect to
 roundRobin: false 
 # a random string of at least 32 characters to secure cookies on the client
 sessionKey: thisisasessionkeyreplacethisjetzt
# Open ID Connect specific settings
openId:
 providerUrl: http://keycloak/auth/realms/test
 clientId: rdpgw
 clientSecret: your-secret
# enabled / disabled capabilities
caps:
 smartCardAuth: false
 tokenAuth: true
 # connection timeout in minutes, 0 is limitless
 idleTimeout: 10
 enablePrinter: true
 enablePort: true
 enablePnp: true
 enableDrive: true
 enableClipboard: true
```

## Use
Point your browser to `https://your-gateway/connect`. After authentication
and RDP file will download to your desktop. This file can be opened by one
of the remote desktop clients and it will try to connect to the gateway and
desktop host behind it.
